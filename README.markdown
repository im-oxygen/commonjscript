Interoperable JScript
=====================

This is an implementation of the [JavaScript Securable Modules Specification](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ServerJS/Modules/SecurableModules) meant to run on ASP or through Windows Script Host. The implentation is based on the one used in [Narwhal](http://github.com/tlrobinson/narwhal/tree/master).

# Usage

`require.js` can be included in a ASP/JScript page or WScript job to provide the `require` function.

`test.asp` and `test.wsf` include runners for some of the tests in the [interoperablejs test suite](http://code.google.com/p/interoperablejs/).
